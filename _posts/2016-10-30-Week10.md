### What did you do this past week?
This past week I started working on Project 4: Darwin with my partner. We had a big dilemma in the beginning of how to approach the problem but we still got a lot done on that day. We actually finished coding the actual problem earlier today but still have to do a lot of the documentation and things of that sort. 

### What's in your way?
There is nothing in my way at the moment. Last week was a little hectic in that I had a lot to do but my schedule has opened up pretty nicely recently.

### What will you do next week?
During this next week I expect to finish Project 4 with my partner and turn that in. We are definitely on pace to finish on time so I'm not really worried about not being able to get that done quickly.

### Pick/Tip of the Week
My tip of the week is to find a place to work that makes you feel comfortable. I say this because it is very important if you want to be productive. I know a lot of people that work in places that are crowded, noisy, or too quiet and it makes them less productive, so I think it's necessary to go out and find a comfortable space to work or study, especially when working on the projects for this class.
