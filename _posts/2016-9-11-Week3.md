### What did you do this past week?
The main thing that I did for this class during the past week was Project 1. It wasn't insanely hard, but I did come across a few bumps in the road that bothered me quite a bit. For instance I had a bit of trouble with Docker in that it would use up all of my disk space during docker commands. I googled the problem and it seemed to be a Docker issue where it would exhuast the inodes available. Eventually I just moved on and did the project without Docker as it was taking up too much of my time. Other than that, everything went smoothly and I turned in the project on time with all requirements. In class we talked about pointers and references which is fairly easy to grasp so there was nothing too hard to understand and it went by smoothly.

### What's in your way?
Funny enough my biggest problems right now are technology issues. Both my laptop and phone are somewhat old and starting to have problems. For instance, my laptop has a battery issue where it will sometimes randomly turn off if not charging at all times. It is a bit annoying to deal with, especially since a significant portion of my classwork is on my laptop. This is my biggest worry at the moment because everything in the class seems to be going fairly smoothly so far.

### What will you do next week?
During this next week, I plan on finding a partner for Project 2 and starting work on that. I believe that we will actually be talking about the 2nd project in class tomorrow as well so that will be a good time to find a partner. Other than that, I won't be doing too much for the class. Because Project 1 was just turned in, there is not much to do and it should be a fairly relaxed week.
